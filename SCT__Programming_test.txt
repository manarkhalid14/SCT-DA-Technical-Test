# She Codes Too Programming Task: Basic Data Manipulation
# You have the following list of numbers:

numbers = [15, 10, 25, 10, 30, 15, 5, 20, 30, 5, 40]

# Use any programming languages of your choice, Write code to perform the following:
    # 1. Calculate the sum and average of all the numbers in the list.
    # 2. Arrange the list in ascending order.


# Expected Output:
# Print the sum of the list.
# Print the average of the list.
# Print the list after it is sorted in ascending order



# Put your answer here, or in any separate file.
